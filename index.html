          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Andrew Quamme. I currently live in Tacoma, WA but I was born and raised in Wisconsin. I joined the Army right out of high school and after my training was stationed at Ft Lewis in 2002. I deployed twice to Iraq where I ran tactical voice and data networks, and after leaving the service in 2007 I worked for Comcast as a cable technician. Last May I finally decided to put my GI Bill to use and left Comcast to return to school full time. I recently completed my AAS in Computer Technology, and am currently a student at Code Fellows to pursue a future in coding and development.</p>

          <p>I enjoy being outside and I feel most at home in the mountains, where I try to spend as much as my time off as possible. I also enjoy running and cycling, and I’ve completed a few half marathons and the “Seattle to Portland” bike ride twice. I’m active in Team Red White and Blue, an organization that connects veterans to their communities through physical and social activity.</p>
              
          <p>I hold an Extra Class Amateur Radio License and volunteer with Pierce County Emergency Management providing communications support to special events in the area-mostly races. We’ve also helped with search and rescue, floods, and in the event of a major disaster we would staff local shelters and city emergency centers. I’m also a volunteer examiner and on occasion will assist with ham radio test sessions in the area.</p>
